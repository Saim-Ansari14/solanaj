        SolanaClient client = new SolanaClient("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
        Transaction transaction = client.sendSOL("fromAddress", "toAddress", 0.1);
        System.out.println("Transaction ID: " + transaction.getTransactionId());
    }
}
```

### Fetching Account Balance

```java
import org.solanaj.SolanaClient;
